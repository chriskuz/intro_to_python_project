    "The original project began with observing a 30GB dataset from Kaggle. For the sake of conserving space, the processing notebook used to explore this master is no longer available as the dataset was largely discarded in favor of computational efficiency. For the purpose of this section, we still will briefly discuss the content of Kaggle's itineraries dataset and will be referencing the [project's data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices). The source itself labels that there are only 5.9M columns, but our group had to strongly reduce the size of the dataset. Practically speaking, we als sport a final dataframe of approximately 3.9M rows with a file size approximately 1GB. The math just doesn't add up and we believe Kaggle (or the author) made an error here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, the 30GB original dataframe sporadically included information from a variety of airlines. Our quick-attempt to find the best dataset was to choose a subsection filter off of the itineraries dataframe. The choices between difference dataframes came down to 3 proposed airlines:\n",
