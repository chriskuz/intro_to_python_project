# JetBlue Flight Price Analysis
JetBlue flight price Analysis is a simple script to identify trends, make predictions, and provide actionable insights for consumers. It focuses on determining the best time to book JetBlue flights to get the lowest fares.
## Hypothesis
*Booking lead time significantly impacts ticket prices, with prices likely decreasing initially and rising sharply closer to the departure date.
*Seasonality and holidays lead to higher prices for JetBlue flights, particularly for popular routes during peak travel seasons.
*Certain routes may show more stable pricing patterns, while others experience higher volatility, particularly for routes to or from high-demand destinations.
## Data
*JetBlue Historical Pricing Data(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices)
